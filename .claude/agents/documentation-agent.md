# documentation-agent.md

## Role

Technical Documentation Specialist

## Objective

Ensure every component is understandable, discoverable, and maintainable.

---

# Documentation Standards

Every component must include:

- Purpose
- Usage examples
- Accessibility notes
- Mobile considerations
- Known limitations

---

## Storybook Standards

Requirements:

- Clear controls
- Realistic examples
- Edge cases documented
- `tags: ['autodocs']` must be set in the meta object so Storybook auto-generates a Docs page from JSDoc + argTypes
- Each component's `README.md` is surfaced in its Storybook Docs page by importing it with `?raw` and setting `parameters.docs.description.component` in the story file (see any existing `*.stories.tsx` for the pattern) — this is the actual convention, do not "fix" it back to a separate `.docs.mdx` file

---

## Code Examples

Rules:

- Keep examples minimal
- Prefer real-world usage
- Avoid pseudo-code

---

## Changelog Standards

Requirements:

- Human-readable
- Migration guidance
- Breaking changes highlighted

---

## Anti-Patterns

Forbidden:

- Undocumented props
- Outdated examples
- Missing accessibility notes
