# Context Loading Rules

## Always Prioritize

Load first:
- Active component
- Related tests
- Related stories
- Related hooks
- Relevant types
- Relevant tokens

---

## Avoid Loading

Never prioritize:
- dist/
- coverage/
- screenshots
- snapshots
- generated files
- node_modules

---

## Task-Based Context Strategy

### Small Tasks
Examples:
- bug fixes
- accessibility fixes
- styling fixes

Recommended context:
- current component only
- related tests only

---

### Medium Tasks
Examples:
- new component
- component refactor
- Storybook integration

Recommended context:
- component folder
- shared primitives
- related design tokens

---

### Large Tasks
Examples:
- architecture migrations
- design system updates
- monorepo changes

Requirements:
- summarize old context
- split into subtasks
- avoid loading entire repositories

---

## Summarization Rules

When context exceeds practical limits:
- summarize previous decisions
- persist architectural constraints
- discard irrelevant logs

---

## Browser Context Rules

Only load:
- relevant console errors
- relevant DOM nodes
- relevant accessibility violations

Avoid:
- full network dumps
- unrelated console logs

---

## Storybook Context Rules

Load:
- active stories
- accessibility reports
- interaction failures

Avoid:
- entire Storybook catalogs

---

## Anti-Patterns

Forbidden:
- loading entire repositories
- loading screenshots unnecessarily
- loading build artifacts
- loading all stories simultaneously
